# Pen-Testing - Certification

The last weeks or better month, i was working on TryhackMe and HacktheBox. On this Platforms i was learning a lot of Cyber Security and Hacking. 
But i was thinking about to prove myself. 

**I want a new challange.**

So i was thinking what can i do, to prove myself what i am learning on this Platform. 
This question can actually only answered with one anser. 

**I NEED A PEN-TESTING CERTIFICATION!!**

But what certification would be a great start. I thought i should go for OSCP. But the thing is, this Certification exam is hard. 
I decided to work harder on my skills and by the end of the year i want to get the OSCP-Certification. 
This is always in my head since i have started my journey in Cyber-Security and hacking. 

On the other hand. i want to get more expirince and more Certification. 
Luckely for me, in the spring of 2021 there is a new Pen-Testing certification out there. 

**The Cyber Menotor** have added a certification to his portfolio. 
And this certificaiton is called **PNPT - practical network penetration tester**

At this point when i heard about the certification, i knew i had to take this exam. 

So i bought a voucher for the Exam. :) 
now i have to study and get my hands on the keyboard for this certification. 

In this Blog i will descripe my way through the learning process of the PNPT-Certification. 

## PNPT - Certification

This Certification contains 5 Sub-categories witch will be done in the exam. 

1. Practical Ethical Hacking
2. Linux Privilage Escalation for Beginners
3. Windows Privilage Escalation for Beginners
4. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Fundamentals
5. External Pentest Playbook

This courses are also available on the TCM-Security Academy. 
And when you buy the voucher of the Exam you can choice between two options. With or without the course Material. 

I have bought the course material a few month ago, when there was no certification around. 
But when i heard of the certification, i knew i had the course material now i have to study.

### Journey

I will work through the course Material. I will try to post a blog post of every interessting topic witch i will learn in this course.

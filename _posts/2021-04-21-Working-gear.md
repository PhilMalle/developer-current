# My Working Gear

Today i want to share my working gear witch i'm using for my daily work at home. 

I have a lot of devices witch are in my Home-Network. Lets start with my Local-Network.

## LAN

Lan-Devices:
1. Huawei B528s
2. Mikrotik 951G-2HnD Routerboard
3. Devolo Magic 2 LAN over Powerline
4. Mikrotik Swtich CSS326-24G-2S+
5. Mikrotik AP RBcAPGi-5acD2nD

for my home-lan i use a default router witch was provided by my provider. It's a Huawei B528s router.

This device is onlye for LTE connection to the outside. I have set it up in Bridge Mode, so i can use my Mikrotik router. 

The next Device is my main Network device. On this i host my DHCP-Server, my WLAN-Configuration and my Guest Access for my WiFi.

My main office is in the cellar, i don't have a LAN-Wire directly to the office. So i decided to go over my Powerline to the office. 

Therefore i have bought the Devolo Magic 2 LAN. One is pluged in near my router ond the other one is near my office. From there i have a LAN-cable to my Mikrotik Switch.

In the office i have also my AP installed. so i have a good WiFi connection. 
I am using my Phone, Tablet and ohter Hardware where i don't have any lan-cable pluged in.

The AP is powered over Ethernet, i have a power injector installed. 

All other devices are connected to my 24-Port switch of Mikrotik.
